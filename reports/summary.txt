They is no further option for help. I\n                can't tolerate this kind of cheating and also the prices are\n                also on higher side, compare to others.  blinkit

There is\n                no other quick delivery agent in my area so I can't compare. I\n                would have given 4 star but 1 star is because of the frustration\n                for whenever there is an issue, you would end up getting\n                frustrated with the customer care. Not really "caring" for their\n                customers. But anyway, I'm stuck with them since I'm have no\n                option to switch to someone else.  blinkit
      1 2024-10-31                 The customer support is very disappointing. I recently bought\n                some electronic products that arrived faulty. I’ve been trying\n                to reach customer support, but my chat sessions keep getting\n                disconnected with the message, "we are currently experiencing a\n                high volume of queries." Initially, I thought it was a one-time\n                issue, but after 3-4 attempts, I received the same response. I\n                then checked on my other, less expensive orders and found that\n                customer care was readily available. BE CAREFUL WITH THIS AP  blinkit
      5 2024-08-29 I've been using Blinkit for a while now, and it has become my\n                go-to app for grocery shopping. The app is well-designed, easy\n                to navigate, and offers a wide range of products. The best part?\n                Super quick delivery, often within minutes! However, one area\n                where Blinkit could take a leaf out of Swiggy's book is the\n                delivery charges. While I appreciate the speed, the added\n                delivery fee cn sometimes make small purchase option or a\n                membership model like instamart would definitely elevate the\n                experience  blinkit

I order\n                items worth 340,the order was paid and after 20 mins they\n                cancelled my order with 'items are out of stock' which was not\n                earlier,the refund would be after 6 days and there is no room\n                for complaint because they have closed the conversation ".\n                Thankyou,blinkit,I would no further order from you again. Highly\n                disappointed. Regards, Nivriti  blinkit
